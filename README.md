A NO-FREE-USAGE action for github. (Only worked with github action.)

# TL;DR
Sometimes you don't want some own the permission to file an issue on your repository, especially when you are being volunteered by this person to do a free bang job for him/her.
It's wasting time if you always close them manually. So here we provide an action to detect whether the user starred or forked or both done, then close & lock the issue if they don't.
